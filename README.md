## INTRO

### Disclaimer
This guide presumes that you know how to use git and the basic concepts of *commit, rebase* and *merge*. 

### Objective
There is no right way to use Git. Therefore, we are giving guidance on using git workflow to simplify this step of your development lifecycle.

## Concepts

### Commits

By simplicity, we have three types of commits:
- __*commits*__: commits made by the user 
- __*merge commits*__: commits through the commend `git merge <branch> --no-ff`
- __*release commits*__: commits using [releasy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/releasy) tool

[Releasy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/releasy) is a tool to simplify the versioning process of a project. It creates a commit with a new version in the `package.json` and creates a *tag* version to this commit.

Commit messages should be written in English following the model: 
```
<Imperative verb> <object>
```

Examples:
- Add PayPal Plus as a new payment method
- Fix profile not showing
- Update React Router
- Remove unused dependency


What *not* to do: 
- Add dot in the end of text Ex: "Update React Router."
- Start with lowercase
- Write in Portuguese

### Branches

Commonly, we have two fixed branches: `master` and `beta`.

The `master` branch must reflect exactly what is in production, it should be treated as __*the single source of truth*__. Is from `master` that every development branch is based on. 

Although the `beta` branch is permanent, it can be a constant override by the team. So, don't keep anything save only in `beta`.

**Important note:** Only *merge commits* should be made on `master` and `beta` branches.

#### Feature branches

You must create a branch based on `master` to start a feature, improvement, or fix. This branch is called a *feature branch*. It must have the following structure name: `<type>/<description>`
The `types` are:
- **feature:** new feature
- **fix:** bug fix
- **update:** e.g.: dependency updates
- **chore:**  tech debt issues
 
A description must be short in kebab-case. It should give a basic understanding of what is being developed on the branch.

Ex: `git checkout -b feature/paypal-plus`.

**Important note:** Only commits should be made in a *feature branch*. None *release or merge commits* should be made. 

## Workflow

### Scenario: I want to develop a feature improvement 

**Step 1.** Create a *feature branch* based on `master`.
```sh
git checkout master
git checkout -b feature/nice-new-thing
```

**Step 2.** Develop the improvement in this *branch* making commits. 

```sh
git commit -m "Add nice new thing"
```

**Step 3.** Do it a *merge commit* of this *feature branch* in `beta` with a flag `--no-ff`.

```sh
git checkout beta
git merge feature/nice-new-thing --no-ff
```

**Step 4.** Do it a *release commit* on `beta` using releasy.

If it is the only *feature branch* in `beta`, use: `releasy`.
If it isn't, use: `releasy pre`.

**Important:** Certify that a published version has `-beta` suffix.

**Step 5.** After publishing the version, wait for the build on Pachamama to end and change the version published in Delorean.

**Step 6.** Test your improvement on the *beta* environment (vtexcommercebeta). If you find bugs,  go to your *feature branch* back to step 2. Otherwise, continue to step 7. 

**Step 7.** Open a Pull Request and ask for a review. PRs are our friends. They ensure that we share knowledge, raise the bar of our code quality, and eventually find bugs. After your PR is approved, go to Step 8. 

**Step 8.** Do it a *release commit* in the *feature branch* using the releasy.

- Add a *minor* version in case of a "feature" or "update": `releasy minor --stable`
- Add a *patch* version in case of a "fix": `releasy patch --stable`

**Important:** Verify that the version doesn't contain the `-beta` suffix. If has, you forgot to use the *flag* `--stable` in releasy.

**Step 9.** Publish the *feature branch* in production: 

Put your commits in `master`, clicking in **Merge Pull Request**. 

**Step 10.** After publishing the new version, wait for the build ends on Pachamama and change the version in Delorean.

**Step 11.** Verify that the changes are in *stable* (vtexcommercestable) and monitor the metrics to certify that your deployment didn't degrade the platform or your service. If you see something wrong, make the rollback in Delorean **immediately**! You can do the troubleshooting later in *beta*.

**Step 12.** Celebrate! You published something in production for millions of people. 

### Scenario: Someone update the `master` branch, and I'm developing something on my *feature branch*

Make *rebase* of your *feature branch*.

```sh
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout feature/nice-new-thing
git rebase master
git push origin feature/nice-new-thing -f
```

**Important note:** Always maintain your *feature branches* rebased in `master`.

### Issues and Pull Requests Templates

A good practice adopted is to use templates for creating Issues and Pull Requests on Github that help you to describe what you are aiming to do with a change proposal. 
To do that, you must create a folder called `.github` in the repository root. Add the files [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE](https://github.com/vtex/dev-guidelines/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](https://github.com/vtex/dev-guidelines/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md). Feel free to change these files, and also, **please give us feedback on these templates**.

Gratitude for the **omnichannel** and **help-center** projects from which we get these templates.
